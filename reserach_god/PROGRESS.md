## Update 2024-11-05 08:28:34

Based on the provided code and file changes, here's a structured summary of significant modifications, focusing on functional alterations:

### **main.py Changes**

- **Simplification and Redundancy Removal:**
  - The `print` statement and the definition of the `messages` variable within the `perform_single_search` function have been removed, with the `messages` variable being reintegrated directly within the API call in a simplified format. This adjustment makes the code more concise and eliminates unnecessary redundancy.

- **Error Handling Enhancement:**
  - The error message printed upon an exception during search has been altered to include a line break (`\n`) at the beginning, aiming to improve readability in the console output.

- **Progress Tracking Feature:**
  - A new feature has been added to track the progress of queries processed in the `perform_web_searches_async` function. The following sub-points detail this enhancement:
    - Introduction of `total_queries` and `completed_queries` variables to keep track of the overall progress.
    - A new nested function `search_with_progress` wraps around the `perform_single_search` call to update and print the progress after each query is completed.
    - Modification in the handling of tasks to utilize `search_with_progress` instead of directly calling `perform_single_search`, enabling real-time progress feedback in the console.

- **Completion Notification:**
  - A print statement has been added to signal the completion of all searches, enhancing user feedback by explicitly indicating when all tasks are done.

### **PROGRESS.md Changes**

- **Documentation Enhancement:**
  - A minor adjustment has been made to the documentation in `PROGRESS.md`, marking an update without specific content changes detailed in the provided snippet. This likely serves as a placeholder or timestamp for tracking progress or modifications in a project timeline.

### **Overall Summary of Modifications:**

- Code cleanup in `main.py` through the removal of redundant code and more seamless integration of variable definitions.
- Improvement in error handling user feedback with formatting adjustments.
- Implementation of a new progress tracking feature, enhancing user interaction by providing real-time updates on the processing of queries.
- Introduction of a user notification indicating the completion of all search queries, aiming to improve the usability and feedback loop of the script.
- Minor administrative update in `PROGRESS.md`, which seems to serve documentation or progression tracking purposes within the project.
